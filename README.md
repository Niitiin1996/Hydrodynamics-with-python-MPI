# Hydrodynamics with python/MPI
 This project aims to explore the divergence-free nature of Incompressible flow, the loss of this property due to approximative derivatives or inexact treatment of boundary conditions, and the application of its correction based on the approach of Helmholtz decomposition of Velocity
